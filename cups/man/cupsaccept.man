The

command instructs the printing system to reject print jobs to the
specified destinations.
The \fI-r\fR option sets the reason for rejecting print jobs. If not specified, the reason defaults to "Reason Unknown".

.SH CONFORMING TO
The
.B cupsaccept
and
.B cupsreject
commands correspond to the System V printing system commands "accept" and "reject", respectively.
Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".
Also, printer and class names are \fInot\fR case-sensitive.
.LP
Finally, the CUPS versions may ask the user for an access password depending on the printing system configuration.
