.SH DESCRIPTION
The CUPS notifier interface provides a standard method for adding support for new event notification methods to CUPS.

.LP
Notifiers \fBMUST\fR read IPP messages from the standard input using the
.BR ippNew ()
and
.BR ippReadFile ()
functions and exit on error.
Notifiers are encouraged to exit after a suitable period of inactivity, however they may exit after reading the first message or stay running until an error is seen.
