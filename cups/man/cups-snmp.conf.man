.SH NAME
snmp.conf \- snmp configuration file for cups
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B snmp.conf
file configures how the standard CUPS network backends (http, https, ipp, ipps, lpd, snmp, and socket) access printer information using SNMPv1 and is normally located in the \fI/etc/cups\fR directory.
Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.
.LP
The Community and DebugLevel directives are used by all backends. The remainder apply only to the SNMP backend -
.BR cups-snmp (8).
.SH DIRECTIVES
The following directives are understood by the CUPS network backends:

There are no default device URI matching rules.
