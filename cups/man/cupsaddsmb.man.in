.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBcupsaddsmb\fR program exports printers to the SAMBA software (version 2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows clients.
Depending on the SAMBA configuration, you may need to provide a password to export the printers.
This program requires the Windows printer driver files described below.
.SS SAMBA CONFIGURATION
\fBcupsaddsmb\fR uses the RPC-based printing support in SAMBA to provide printer drivers and PPD files to Windows client machines.
In order to use this functionality, you must first configure the SAMBA
.BR smb.conf (5)
file to support printing through CUPS and provide a printer driver download
share, as follows:
.nf

    [global]
	load printers = yes
	printing = cups
	printcap name = cups

    [printers]
	comment = All Printers
	path = /var/spool/samba
	browseable = no
	public = yes
	guest ok = yes
	writable = no
	printable = yes

    [print$]
	comment = Printer Drivers
	path = /etc/samba/drivers
	browseable = yes
	guest ok = no
	read only = yes
	write list = root

.fi
This configuration assumes a FHS-compliant installation of SAMBA; adjust the [printers] and [print$] share paths accordingly on your system as needed.
.SS MICROSOFT POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS
The base driver for Windows 2000 and higher is the Microsoft PostScript driver, which is available on any system running Windows 2000 or higher in the %WINDIR%\\SYSTEM32\\SPOOL\\DRIVERS\\W32X86\\3 folder for 32-bit drivers and %WINDIR%\\SYSTEM32\\SPOOL\\DRIVERS\\X64\\3 folder for 64-bit drivers.
.LP
Copy the 32-bit drivers to the \fI/usr/share/cups/drivers\fR directory and the 64-bit drivers to the \fI/usr/share/cups/drivers/x64\fR directory exactly as named below:
.nf

    ps5ui.dll
    pscript.hlp
    pscript.ntf
    pscript5.dll

.fi
\fBNote:\fR Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure that you use the lowercase filenames shown above, otherwise \fBcupsaddsmb\fR will fail to export the drivers.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBcupsaddsmb\fR supports the following options:
.TP 5
\fB\-H \fIsamba-server\fR
Specifies the SAMBA server which defaults to the CUPS server.
.TP 5
\fB\-U \fIsamba-user\fR[\fB%\fIsamba-password\fR]
Specifies the SAMBA print admin username which defaults to your current username.
If the username contains a percent (%) character, then the text following the percent is treated as the SAMBA password to use.
.TP 5
.B \-a
Exports all known printers.
Otherwise only the named printers are exported.
.TP 5
\fB\-h \fIcups-server\fR[\fB:\fIport\fR]
Specifies a different CUPS server to use.
.TP 5
.B \-v
Specifies that verbose information should be shown.
This is useful for debugging SAMBA configuration problems.
