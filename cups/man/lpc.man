.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lpc
[
.I command
[
.I parameter(s)
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlpc\fR provides limited control over printer and class queues provided by CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of queues.
.LP
If no command is specified on the command-line, \fBlpc\fR displays a prompt and accepts commands from the standard input.
.SS COMMANDS
The \fBlpc\fR program accepts a subset of commands accepted by the Berkeley \fBlpc\fR program of the same name:
.TP 5
.B exit
Exits the command interpreter.
.TP 5
\fBhelp \fR[\fIcommand\fR]
.TP 5
\fB? \fR[\fIcommand\fR]
Displays a short help message.
.TP 5
.B quit
Exits the command interpreter.
.TP 5
\fBstatus \fR[\fIqueue\fR]
Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.
.SH NOTES
Since \fBlpc\fR is geared towards the Berkeley printing system, it is impossible to use \fBlpc\fR to configure printer or class queues provided by CUPS.
To configure printer or class queues you must use the
.BR lpadmin (8)
command or another CUPS-compatible client with that functionality.
