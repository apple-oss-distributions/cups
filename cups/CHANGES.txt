	  and set the current (cached) authorization string to use for
	  HTTP requests.
	- Updated the default cupsd.conf policy to list the
	  "administrative" operations separately from the "printer
	  control" operations so that it is easier to define a
	  group of users that are "printer operators".
	- The web interface now pulls the default cupsd.conf file
	  from cupsd.conf.default in the CUPS config directory.
	- Added a help file for using Kerberos with CUPS.

	  compiler and include all of the localized languages by
	  default (STR #2164)
	- You can now specify "AuthType Default" in the cupsd.conf
	  file to use the default authentication defined by the
	  DefaultAuthType directive.
	- The SNMP backend no longer adds a default Address line
	  when none is specified in the snmp.conf file; this allows
	  the backend to be easily disabled as needed (STR #2434)
	- Added a new cupsctl command for doing basic changes to
	  the cupsd.conf file (STR #1777)
	- Added a new ppdLocalizeIPPReason() function to get the
	  localized text/URI for a given IPP reason keyword for a
	  driver.
	- Removed the deskjet2.ppd driver, as it only worked with
	  a very small subset of HP DeskJet printers and was
	  confusing to users.  The rastertohp driver still
	  supports the deskjet2.ppd options for existing queues.
	- The scheduler did not add a trailing banner page if a
	  client did not specify the last document in a job (STR

	- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports the cupsModelNumber attribute
	  from a PPD file in the ppd-model-number attribute (STR
	  #2383)
	- CUPS_GET_PPDS now reports a driver type string in the
	  ppd-type attribute based on the cupsFax and cupsFilter
	  attributes in a PPD file (STR #2383)
	- Added a new printer attribute called "cups-version"
	  which reports the version of CUPS that is running
	  (STR #2240)
	- backendRunLoop() now aborts immediately on SIGTERM
	  if no data has been written yet (STR #2103)
	- Due to poor IPP support from the vendors, the SNMP
	  backend no longer tries IPP connections; instead,
	  it now uses a lookup file with fallback to port 9100
	  (socket://address) and 515 (lpd://address) printing
	  (STR #2035, STR #2354) 
	- The scheduler now recreates the CUPS log directory as

          of array elements (STR #2358)
        - ppdConflicts() optimizations (STR #2358)
	- The cupstestppd program now tests for existing filters,
	  icons, profiles, and dialog extensions (STR #2326)

	  main administration page.  Instead, a new "List Available
	  Printers" button is provided that shows a separate page
	  with the list of printers.
	- The web interface now supports setting the banner and
	  policy options on raw printers and classes (STR #2238)
	- The socket backend now reads any pending back-channel
	  data before shutting down the socket (STR #2325)

	  from PPD files in CUPS-Get-PPDs responses (STR #1900)

	- The default configuration now allows browse packets from
	  any address (STR #2008)
	- The web interface now provides an "allow printing from the
	  Internet" check box (STR #1897)

	  notify-lease-duration-default attributes can now be set
	  (STR #1671)
	- Server-side default options are now sent to clients when
	  the "printer-defaults" attribute group is requested (STR
	  #1923)
	- Added support for Linux "relro" linker option (STR #1614)
	- CUPS now validates the number-up option value (STR #1329)
	- The on-line help now provides better search capabilities

	  instead of select() when possible (STR #1261)
	- Added new cupsArrayGetIndex() and cupsArrayGetInsert()
	  functions to get the current index and insertion
	  positions of an array.

	  which specifies the character set that is used in PJL
	  strings (STR #1969)
	- Moved the definition of the (private) _http_s structure
	  to http-private.h; code that directly accesses the
	  http_t members will no longer compile!
	- Added support for setting the document-format-default
	  attribute on a per-printer basis.
	- Added support for IntelliBar label printers.
